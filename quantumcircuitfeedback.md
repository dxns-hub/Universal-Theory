# Quantum Circuit Feedback

- **Created by using 2 qubits (2^2 = 4 states)**

## Detailed Base System Analysis:
============================

1. Binary (Base-2):
   - States: [0, 1]
   - Primary function: Sign determination (positive/negative)
   - Acts as the fundamental switch

2. Base-4:
   - States: [0, 1, 2, 3]
   - Serves as intermediate encoding
   - Each state can map to base-6 through modulo operation

3. Base-6:
   - States: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   - Emerges from base-4 through modulo mapping
   - Each state can exist in positive or negative form (due to binary)

## Feedback Loop Explanation:
========================
1. Binary provides the sign (+ or -)
2. Base-4 provides intermediate states
3. These map to base-6 states
4. Each base-6 state can be positive or negative
5. This creates the loop: Binary → Base-4 → Base-6 → Binary

## Example Mapping:
==============
Base-4 value 0 → Base-6 value 0
  Can be positive (0) or negative (1) from binary
Base-4 value 1 → Base-6 value 1
  Can be positive (0) or negative (1) from binary
Base-4 value 2 → Base-6 value 2
  Can be positive (0) or negative (1) from binary
Base-4 value 3 → Base-6 value 3
  Can be positive (0) or negative (1) from binary
